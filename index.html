	<h1>Welcome to my GitHub Webpages</h1>
	<h2>A word</h2>
	<p>
		This Github repository will host all files relevant to my Github website which is currently in its very early stage.
		The website is meant to host different kinds of experiments which I would like to share with others. 
		The main goal here is to have fun as I delve deeper into machine learning. 
		I am certain that there wil be many points of improvement throughout this journey, therefore, feedback will always be most welcome and appreciated.
